## Troubleshooting

- If extraction fails, write in  the Log sheet for detailed error messages
- Ensures proper URL formatting

## Performance Considerations

99% accuracy expected as designed.



***Important Notes: This project should be 100% functional through Spreadsheet and Web App platform. So-***
1. All functions must double check for performance status
2. Web app buttons should connected so that this project can also run from web app and from anywhere
3. Must need a good looking and userfriendly design and looking
4. Web app will be the core platform for operating the project and spreadsheet is only for data storage.
5. So we must need a feature of URL upload if we need to add new URLs then we will add them there and it will get input on spreadsheet's base Column A "URL"
6. so, the Web app's features should be
* Main Page with all the buttons and a dashboard of overall processes
* Data Center for the visibility of extracted data with advanced filtering system like we can filter with many headers, many aspects. Data center must have the reporting system as designed with correct calculation system.
* Logs in here will be 2 options in dropdown
        #Extraction Log
        #Error Log
* If possible we need user logging options. The Credentials will stored in the spreadsheet and with these credential anyone can entered into web app and operate the task.
         # Super Admin
         # Admin
         # User


****-But after making all scripting and all other things, we need all the functions, mockup,, and whatever neede for run the project should connects and respond as the expectation briefed over.****
